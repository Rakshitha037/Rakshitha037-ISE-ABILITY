You are given the height H (in metres) and mass M (in kilograms). The Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person is computed as M/H^2 .
Report the category into which a person falls, based on his BMI:
	Category 1: Underweight if BMI ≤18
	Category 2: Normal weight ifBMI ∈\{19, 20,…, 24\}
	Category 3: Overweight if BMI ∈\{25, 26,…, 29\}
	Category 4: Obesity if BMI ≥30

You will be given an array of N integers and you have to print the integers in the reverse order.
Input Format
The first line of the input contains N ,where N  is the number of integers. The next line contains  N space-separated integers.
Constraints
1≤N≤1000
1≤A[i]≤10000 where A[i] is the ith integer in the array.
